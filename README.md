## 🎯 Objective:
To analyze and interpret insurance sales performance across different categories (Cross Sell, New, Renewal), identify top-performing account executives, and provide actionable insights to improve revenue.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Excel** – for data cleaning & initial analysis  
- **Power BI** – for dashboard visualization  
- **MySQL** – for data import and basic queries  
- **Tableau** – (explored in training)

## 👤 My Contribution (Babitha Kudikala):
- Created Excel dashboards and Power BI visuals

- Collaborated on SQL querying and Power BI dashboard layout

## 📈 Key KPIs:
- Number of Invoices by Account Executive  
- Target vs Achieved vs Invoice (for Cross Sell, New, Renewal)  
- Yearly Meeting Count (2019 vs 2020)  
- Stage Funnel by Revenue  
- Top Open Opportunities  
- Number of Meetings by Executive

## 🧠 Key Insights:
- ✅ **‘New’ category** achieved the target, but had low invoice value compared to ‘Cross Sell’ and ‘Renewal’  
- ✅ **Abhinav Shivam** had the highest meeting count across both years  
- ✅ In 2019, only 3 account executives were active; by 2020, the number increased to 31  
- ✅ **Divya Dhingra** led in renewals among all executives

## 📌 Business Suggestions:
- Focus on enhancing the ‘New’ category’s conversion to increase invoice value
